    <h1 class="title-two"><b>Original Pancake House Website</b></h1>
    <div class="row align-items-top justify-content-center introduction">
      <div class="col-lg-5 col-md-12 description justify-content-center">
        <h5><p>For this project, I chose the redesign the website of one of my favorite restaurants in my hometown.</p> 
          <p>The Original Pancake House is a well known national franchise with over 100 locations nationwide, 
            so I expected their website to be very fleshed out.</p> <p>I was shocked to find that it was quite 
              difficult to use and interpret. I chose to redesign this website and began by identifying usability 
              and accessibility problems.</p> </h5>

    <div class="usability">
      <h1 class="title-two"><b>Usability Problems</b></h1>
      <h5><p> I began by idenfying design problems in four main areas; usability, memorability, learnability, and efficiency. My findings are summarized here:</p>
      </h5>
      <div class="prob-container row align-items-top justify-content-center">
        <div class="problem1 col-lg-3 col-xs-12">
          <h2 class="text-center" style="padding-bottom: 12px;">Usability</h2>
          <div>
            <ul>High contrast colors (all bright primary colors) and strange grouping can overwhelm the user when they first look at it</ul>
            <ul>No adaptabilities for different sizes of screens and does not resize well</ul>
            <ul>Too many different typefaces and layout styles confuse the user</ul>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="problem1 col-lg-3 col-xs-12">
          <h2 class="text-center" style="padding-bottom: 12px;">Memorability</h2>
          <div>
            <ul>Hard to interpret information because it is not grouped or clearly sectioned</ul>
            <ul>The cluttered top contrasted with the excess white space towards the end of the webpage overwhelms and confuses the user</ul>
            <ul>There isnâ€™t any one element (name, logo, slogan) that clearly stands out to the user when they first look at the page</ul>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="problem1 col-lg-3 col-xs-12">
          <h2 class="text-center" style="padding-bottom: 12px;">Learnability</h2>
          <div>
            <ul>Inconsistent use of typefaces makes it difficult to comprehend the content and see the hierarchy</ul>
            <ul>Lots of long descriptions with only two (bad quality) images makes it hard to remember and interpret information</ul>
            <ul>The lack of a clear hierarchy makes it difficult to to know which information is being presented on the page and where to look for it</ul>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="col-lg-3 col-xs-12">
          <h2 class="text-center" style="padding-bottom: 12px;">Efficiency</h2>
          <div>
            <ul>Lots of repetition in content across the different pages of the website which could confuse the user on where to look</ul>
            <ul>Confusing to nagivate the webpage because there is a top menu and a left menu</ul>
            <ul>Inconsistent and uneven spacing between elements and too much white space makes it hard to look for information</ul>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="accessibility">
      <h1 class="title-two"><b>Accessibility Issues</b></h1>
      <h5>By using WebAIM WAVE to identify accessibility concerns, I found contrast errors found on the 
        homepage where there is very little contrast between some of the text and the background. 
        The page was also missing many heading levels and overall structural components. I also used a 
        screenreader to examine more accesibility concerns and found that much of the homepage's main 
        content was not recognized by the screenreader. This was probably due to the fact that many heading 
        levels were missing on this webpage (as detected by WebAIM WAVE) and that the page was lacking an 
        overall structure that made it easier to read and detect. Ultimately, these finding were very concerning
        because it demonstrates that the original website has nearly no adaptability and is very inaccessible. 
        </h5>
    </div>

    <div class="lofi">
      <h1 class="title-two"><b>Prototyping</b></h1>
      <h5><p>Next I created simple wireframe prototypes of a potential new interface for the homepage of this website. 
        I tried to remedy many of the design issues I saw above in these prototypes. For example, I established 
        clear sections and grouped information into these sections so that the webpage would be easier to read and parse 
        and so that it was more visually appealing. More information on how I chose to fix the issues that were identified
        can be found directly on the prototypes themselves. The lofi prototypes are a rough first look of the structure of 
        the webpage with placeholders for many of the elements. I created these prototypes in three different screen sizes
        (website, tablet, and mobile) to better demonstrate how the page will adapt as the screen size shrinks and grows. </p>
        <p>Once I finished these lofi prototypes, I moved onto creating more high fidelity prototypes that would 
          illustrate how these designs could be turned into an actual webpage. These were based off of the structure 
          outlined in the lofi prototypes, but I filled in many of the missing elements and added important stylistic
          choicse. In these prototypes, I annotated 
          significant design choices and their implementation so that they could be easily translated into a real
          webpage by any designer. Similar to the lofi prototypes, I created three screen size mockups. </p>

        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="style-guide">
      <h1 class="title-two"><b>Style Guide</b></h1>
      <h5>Next, I created a style guide to reflect the design choices and interactive states in my design.
        This design guide serves as a useful tool for both myself and other potential designs. It ensures
        that I remain consistent in my implementation and designs and that there is a unified and coherent 
        experience in the webpage, but it also is useful because it would allow any other designer to "pick up 
        where I left off" and redesign other pages of the website using a similar style to the redesigned 
        homepage. 
      </h5>
      <div class="sg-cont row align-items-center justify-content-center">
        <img src="SG1.jpg" alt="Style Guide" class="col-lg-6 col-xs-12"/>
        <img src="SG2.jpg" alt="Style Guide" class="col-lg-6 col-xs-12"/>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="conclusion align-items-center justify-content-center">
      <h1 class="title-two"><b>Finally I created the new homepage!</b></h1>
      <h2 class="title-one text-center"><b>Take a look:</b></h2>

      </div>
      <h5> Ultimately, I found this project to be really fun and rewarding! It was great to examine
        an existing website and to be able to critique it and learn about which formal principles of 
        design it violated. It was also really great to think about how I could improve this website
        on my own and how I organize the information that it presented. Ultimately, the website that I 
        created ended up being very responsive and made adjustments for smaller screen sizes that made
        it usable on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
